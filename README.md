## How to navigate the repository

The repository is divided in folders. Here is an overview to make your navigation easier.

- [code](https://github.com/toelt-llc/RESEARCH-MRI-Analysis/tree/main/code): in this folder you will find all the code used for the analysis and the figure creation.  
    - subfolders contain previous steps and attempts at attention, simpe siamese CNN and the first prepocessing scripts
    - [code/siamese_torch](https://github.com/toelt-llc/RESEARCH-MRI-Analysis/tree/main/code/siamese_torch) contains the latest pytorch siamese network version, with its complete training process. 
<!-- - [data](): in this folder you will find all the data that have been used or measured.   -->
<!-- - [docs](): in this folder you will find information as: **papers, pdfs, any docs**   -->
<!-- - [results](): in this folder you will find the datafiles of the results that will be used to prepare final plots for publications. **With links** -->
