# MRI image analysis

This repository contains siamese model research applications on image analysis methods for 2D MRIs. 

## Status 
**Writing-phase**  
:hourglass_flowing_sand:

### TODO steps 

- [x] List of preprocessing methods applied and available as examples
- [x] Siamese network code
- [x] Siamese backbones in the training loop
- [x] Data processing and tf/torch compatible
- [x] Evaluation dataset
- [x] Documented steps of processing and methods
- [x] Noise simulation code clean
- [x] Evaluation of results and recap (wandb available)
- [ ] Args check, GPU selection check

## How to navigate the repository
- [code](): in this folder you will find all the code used for the analysis and the figure(s) creation.
    - [code/0_data_load]() notebook containing the data pre-processing commands and step-by-step illustrations.
    - [code/1_data_save]() notebook containing the basic local data save code.
    - [code/siamese_torch]() contains the latest pytorch siamese network version, with its complete training process.

<!-- - [data](): in this folder you will find all the data that have been used or measured.   -->
